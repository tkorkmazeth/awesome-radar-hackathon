## What is Solana Radar Hackathon

Superteam Turkey held a 2-day IRL hackathon bootcamp at Facebook Station in Istanbul from September 7-8. The goal was to support participants for the upcoming Radar Hackathon and kickstart their journey into building on Solana.

Participants were given hands-on training on the fundamentals of Solana, including topics such as Anchor Framework, Solana Program Library (SPL), and using Metaplex for NFTs. The event featured mentorship sessions, coding workshops, and real-world examples to help builders familiarize themselves with the tools needed to compete in the hackathon tracks.

### Tracks

The Solana Radar Hackathon has several tracks for participants to focus on:

1. **DeFi & Payments**
2. **NFTs & Collectibles**
3. **Social and Content Protocols**
4. **Governance**
5. **Tooling and Infrastructure**

This guide aims to provide resources for each track to help developers build robust applications on Solana.
